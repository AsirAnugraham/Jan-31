Five keyword to handle the exception 

Try - The try keyword  is used to specify a block where we should place an exception code. 
*It means we can't use try block alone. The try block must be followed by either catch or finally.

catch - the catch block is used to handle the exception. 
*It must be preceded by try block which means we can't use catch block alone. 
*It can be followed by finally block later.

Finally - the finally block is used to execute the necessary code of the program. 
*It is executed whether an exception is handled or not.

Throw - The throw keyword is used to throw an exception

Throws -The throws keyword is used to declare exceptions. 
*It specifies that there may occur an exception in the method. 
*It doesn't throw an exception. 
*It is always used with method signature.
